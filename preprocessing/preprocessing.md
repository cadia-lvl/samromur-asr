# Preprocessing Samromur-ASR

## Steps to write about here

What do we need to prepare so that our data can be fed into the Kaldi data prep
pipeline.
* We need to normalize our text.
* Create a corpus for the language model.
* The lexicon. We need a g2p model to transcribe the phonemes that aren't in our lexicon.
