## 1. Introduction

Samrómur ASR is a collection of scripts, recipes, and tutorials for training an ASR using the [Kaldi-ASR](http://kaldi-asr.org/) toolkit.

[s5_base](/s5_base) is the regular ASR recipe. It's meant to be the foundation of our Samrómur recipes.


## 2. The Dataset

The Samrómur speech corpus is an open (CC-BY 4 licence) and accessible database of voices that everyone is free to use when developing software in Icelandic.
The database consists of sentences and audio clips from the reading of those sentences as well as metadata about the speakers. Each entry in the database contains a WAVE audio clip and the corresponding text file.
The Samrómur speech corpus will be available for download soon on [CLARIN-IS](http://clarin.is/gogn/).
For more information about the dataset visit [https://samromur.is/gagnasafn](https://samromur.is/gagnasafn).

## 3. Setup
